### Description

A complete new rebuild of my award winning EyeDropper Control. Now a 100% Dependency free control.

Better Drawing, Better Font handling, No Dependencies, Better menu Handling... to many to mention.

The control now uses subclassing from Paul Caton (thanks Paul) And the cMemdc for drawing From Vlad Vissoultchev (Thanks Vlad) Awesome code From two very talented programmers.

Take a look and tell me what you think. As Always comments and constructive critisim is always welcome.

Note:

1) You MUST Copy the WinSubHook.tlb Located in then tlb folder to you system folder.

2) The Control Doesn't Support 32bit Alpha Icons As Yet (Vlad If You have Any Idea on how to do this - I Would Be Very Interested indeed)

Regards

Gary
